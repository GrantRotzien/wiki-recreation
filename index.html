          <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. Named after the Roman god of agriculture, it is a gas giant with an average radius about nine times that of Earth. Although it has only one-eighth the average density of Earth, it is over 95 times more massive. A core, probably iron–nickel and rock, is surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and a gaseous outer layer. Ammonia crystals give the upper atmosphere a pale yellow hue. Electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to the planetary magnetic field. Wind speeds can reach 1,800 km/h (500 m/s), higher than on Jupiter, but not as high as on Neptune. A prominent ring system with nine continuous main rings and three smaller arcs is composed mostly of ice particles, with some rocky debris and dust. Saturn has hundreds of moonlets and at least 62 moons, including Titan, the second-largest moon in the Solar System and the only one with a substantial atmosphere. (Full article...) </p>

          <p>Lorem Ipsum is the standard filler text used in design throughout the world. It’s been the standards since the 1500’s and it’s time for an update. The NASA OpenGov team took the opportunity at Science Hack Day to create a new online tool to generate filler text based on a database of historical space quotes. The project serves as an example of what can be done to utilize historic NASA data and mash it up in a new and exciting way. Although a “lorem ipsum” generator may seem inconsequential at first glance, the weekend project will serve as the backbone to a future data mashup project for the NASA OpenGov team. We’d appreciate your comments and feedback and have provided more information about the history of Lorem Ipsum and the tool we’ve created below.

            The History of Lorem Ipsum

            Lorem ipsum is slightly jumbled latin, the remnants of a sections 1.10.32–3 from Cicero’s ”de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum” (The Extremes of Good and Evil), which begins with the words ‘Neque porro quisquam est qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit…’ which means “there is no one who loves pain itself, who seeks after it and wants to have it, simply because it is pain”. Written in 45 BC, this treatise on the theory of ethics was very popular in the Renaisance, and the jumpled version of the text started to be used in the 1500’s as filler text for designers and has been the industry standard since then.</p>

            <p>Lorem Ipsum text is used because readable text is often a distraction during the design process. For example, when designing a website, a designer will insert lorem ipsum text if the place of real text. Instead of looking at the layout to find the problems or weak spots, people will unconsciously focus on the words. For years, designers have depended on this latin gibberish to help them to focus on the positioning, spacing, color, and other stylistic elements.</p>
